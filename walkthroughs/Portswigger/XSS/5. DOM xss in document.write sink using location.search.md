according to portswigger:
DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as `eval()` or `innerHTML`. This enables attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, which typically allows them to hijack other users' accounts.

Now what is this `sink`?
A sink is **a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it**.
like this in the lab here:
![[Pasted image 20230717185801.png]]
document.write is a function that writes any given value to the "document" aka DOM  , we have a search funcitonality , when we search something and look at the code:
![[Pasted image 20230717190229.png]]
we not only get the single picture filtered but the code says:
![[Pasted image 20230717190603.png]]
line 1 : take the query entered by the user and append it into the url like this:
![[Pasted image 20230717190709.png]]
line 2: extract the value of the "search" query parameter from the URL of the current web page and assign it to the query variable
***
1. `window.location.search`: This retrieves the query string from the URL of the current web page. The query string is everything that follows the "?" in the URL.
2. `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)`: This creates a new URLSearchParams object, which allows easy access to the query parameters in the URL.
3. `.get('search')`: This method of the URLSearchParams object is used to retrieve the value of the "search" query parameter. If the "search" parameter exists in the URL, it returns its value; otherwise, it returns null.
***
line 3 and 4: if the value of query exists: then search the query and display the post regarding it

So the `Sink` here from above definition is the function `document.write` function that is taking our value

we can also check where our value is going is via pressing `f12` and in the console we execute this code:
`location.search`
![[Pasted image 20230717191606.png]]
## Step 2:
### See how our value is being displayed:
When we look at the DOM changed by the js above we see that is where the query is :
![[Pasted image 20230717191332.png]]
`src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=game"`
so always ask yourself : can we escape the tag here and inject our own tags?
like
`searchTerms=game"/><script>alert(1)</script>`
so can we pollute the sink?
let's try
```
"/><script>alert(1)</script>
```
## Step 3
### Pollution of sink 
and we get the alert
![[Pasted image 20230717192126.png]]

now we need to consider that some javascript code can be containing filters so we need to bypass that too , I'll cover that in next blog
