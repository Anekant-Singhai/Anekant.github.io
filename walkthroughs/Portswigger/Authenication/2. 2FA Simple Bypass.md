###  problem statement

***This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's credentials `carlos:montoya`

To test a functionality of a web-app, we first need to look how it what , what is the flow of the application and how the flow is executed at the back-end

### checking the flow:
Now when we go to the application to login with the provided credentials we see that it has a login form , and an email client 
as where we will get our 2FA code 
so we login , it asks for the code , we go to the email client and give it the code we got , we now are further redirected to the my-account page that is the profile of the user

so the *flow* is :
login -> 2FA check -> account access

Now to think  , do we really need to provide the code? 
can we break the 2nd step and login without code , by calling the end-point directly?

let's try:
we entered the creds for the `carlos` and rather than giving away the code we just typed : *my-account*
and 

It actually worked:

Impact:
Account takeover via flawed logic or flow implementation


Another things to look for :
* can we brute-force the code by capturing it to burp?
* can we send multiple requests to the email client of the legit user we go the creds of via capturing it?
