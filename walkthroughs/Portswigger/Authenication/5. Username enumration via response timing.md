This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

There is a rate limit when we send the request too much:

So we first need to find out what was the main root of being blocked , is it checking our cookie? we tried deleting it ,NOPE
was it the referrer , origin header? not at all
so two possibilities remain :
It is storing some kind of value that identifies us but we can't see any or one thing that identifies us without us sending it in the request is `IP`
so let's try faking our IP to the server , how:
via this header:
*X-Forwarded-For:*
like this: 
`X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.29.38`
Whenever we assign the IP to it after 3 attempts it blocks , so whenever we change the IP we can resend or reuse those 3 attempts

### IMPACT:
*Highest*:
#AccountTakeover via rate-limit bypass:
if an attacker has a precise wordlist targeted just for your firm , it can bypass RL and can perform ATO

*Lowest*:
#user-enumeration via response timing:
![[Pasted image 20230703141052.png]]
we pass the payload position to ip and to the username,when we get the username right we will get an abnormal timing as some websites have a functionality that if the username is correct then they check the password which causes the delay just like the above case ,
*NOTE*: the functionality is implemented as if the username is correct then check for password , and if the give the password of enormous length it will take much more time as to compare some big strings
then we can bruteforce the password for that username:
