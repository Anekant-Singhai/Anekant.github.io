<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>login</h1><br/><p>This is the classic example of why you should see the obfuscated js in the client side , the login oage generates no request to the server so everything is client side and also we need tyo look who and who does they authenticate it</p><p></p><p>so we need to see the js file and there we can see that there&#39;s a function called the btoa that says if the username is not this YWRtaW4 and password not this cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ display incorrect</p><p></p><p>if we look at this , it looks encoded and when we search the online cipher finder , we can see that it&#39;s base 64 encoded. so using the tool called basecack we can crack it , supply it and and as we crack the password we get the flag</p></div>
