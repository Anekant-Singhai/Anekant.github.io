we are give a list of user names and passwords , so we can bruteforce them

Approach :
>we look at whether is there any rate limit or not bu sending wrong requests a few times .... in this case there's not 
>
>we also look for the  error it gives , invalid user or invalid password 
>if we don't have the right username or passwrod we look at the length of response by bruteforcing username while keeping the password intact

in this case:
look how the error was changed:

now we get to know the error here:
![[Pasted image 20230609143909.png]]

giving away the legit user and this concluded our user-enum search 
impact: user-data could be leaked and due to no bruteforcing limiting
he account takeover is possible due to weak passwords

Now for knowing which password is legit we can see that the password when right will give us the different response that others and also sometimes it will try to redirect us to the user page from login thus giving the status code in range of 300-400:

like here 2000

thus we solved the lab
