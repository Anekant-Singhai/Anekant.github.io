This lab contains a [DOM-based cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based) vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's `$()` selector function to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via the `location.hash` property.

To solve the lab, deliver an exploit to the victim that calls the `print()` function in their browser.

code working:
![[Pasted image 20230719162154.png]]
This code is adding an event listener to the window object for the 'hashchange' event. When the hash part of the URL changes, this event will be triggered.

Inside the event handler function, the code retrieves the hash part of the URL using `window.location.hash`. The `decodeURIComponent` function is used to decode the URL-encoded hash string, removing any special characters that might have been encoded.

Next, the code searches for a `h2` element inside a `section` element with the class 'blog-list' that contains the text equal to the decoded hash value. It uses the `:contains()` selector to find the matching `h2` element.

If a matching `h2` element is found (i.e., `post` is truthy), the code calls `get(0)` on the `post` object to retrieve the DOM element corresponding to the `h2` element. Then, it calls the `scrollIntoView()` method on the DOM element to scroll the page so that the `h2` element is brought into view in the browser window.

In summary, this code allows for smooth scrolling to a specific blog post on the page based on the hash part of the URL. When the hash changes (e.g., when clicking on a link with a hash reference to a blog post), the page will scroll to display the corresponding blog post on the screen.

also when we pass the hash to this function:

![[Pasted image 20230719164240.png]]
we see this , so what if we provide the hash wrt the post they gave?:
It automatically scrolls down to the post containing that word:

Let's see where this renders:
this is our sink btw:
![[Pasted image 20230719164857.png]]
It does is if the word containing the post is given : get it
so can we make it get any url we want?, like make it visit 
can the get() function do that?
MDN says we can get the parameters from it:
![[Pasted image 20230719165223.png]]
NOPE
this gives us the alert: 
![[Pasted image 20230719165906.png]]

but we somehow need to invoke the print() function and deliver it to the user...hmm, but how will the user know if the site it real? can we use iframe?
let's try:
the print works fine:
![[Pasted image 20230719170350.png]]

so we craft an iframe request that when a victim presses the invokes the print function:
```html
<iframe src="https://0a8c00820351fe4a80216cf6005c00f8.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=print()>'">
```

the part `onload` says please on clicking load the url provided with the payload that was invoking the function like this:
![[Pasted image 20230719171617.png]]
, the idea behind this exploit is that attacker can give any harmful function to do so
