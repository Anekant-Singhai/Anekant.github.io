we can add multiple applications to a single projects via this capability of django , we can create a blog website with the help of django 
first we create a mini project named blog in our site and initiate it via:
`python3 manage.py startapp blog_site`
A new folder with some files in it is created with this command
we first open the views.py file that contains what to serve whenever the page is loaded

we also create a urls.py file where we will specify the paths for our site that can browsed. we add the "urlpatterns" list where we specify the path of each of the functionality we implement

we also go to the main urls.py file in the main project and add the urls there as it'll serve our pages 

main url.py:
