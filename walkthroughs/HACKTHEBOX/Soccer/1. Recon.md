## Nmap
Using the command :
`grc nmap -A -sV -sC -p- 10.10.11.194 -o nmap_result`

where grc is the generic colouriser that can help us see the result in a coloured manner and flags:
-A : Aggressive is a mix of 3 -> -sC -O -traceroute
-sV : for version detection
-sC : basic script scan
-p- : for all the ports , it do however scan top 1000

while the command runs we also do the banner grabbing via netcat on the port 80 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 443 , 3306 {we try to see if they are open}

we get the response from port 22 , 80 
so let's look at them:

### port 80
looks like this

The first approach that comes to my mind is to look at the source code:
and also into that specifically the image , script , a, and those tags that embed the resources to the page that lead us to either new path or subdomain or something
I also look for the files like:
* Robots.txt
* sitemap.xml  or .txt
404 for both
while in parallel applied the directory fuzzing and since it isn't a live target , we can apply  threads but if you try on live ones , max threads 5 and each request in 5 sec or 3 sec or you'll be blocked

we get the results from the ffuf with the seclist's wordlist:big.txt
* .htaccess
* .htpasswd
* tiny

while the above two gave the 401 forbidden we get a NFS {Network file manager for developes} running on the /tiny webpage

and the  last embed link takes us to the github of this file manager
this must not be found during production , as it is for developers only and the first thing that I do after finding such grave mistake is look for the default credentials and this github gave me that :

and BOOM!!! we are in:
