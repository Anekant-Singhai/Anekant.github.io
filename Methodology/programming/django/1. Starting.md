There are many files already created and let's see what they are and what to do them
-> there's main :
manage.py 
then inside the folders: 
- init.py : used to initiate the python package
- settings.py : change the different settings , debug=true/false is here toggled
- urls.py : setting the mappings to where we send the user
we can do `python3 manage.py runserver` to run the server
