just a basic sqli auth bypass :

Background:
In this example we used ' or 1=1 -- .

This causes the application to perform the query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1-- ' AND password = 'foo'`

Because the comment sequence (--) causes the remainder of the query to be ignored, this is equivalent to:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' ' OR 1=1`

In this example the SQL injection attack has resulted in a bypass of the login, and we are now authenticated as "admin".
