<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>shop</h1><br/><p>this challenge was to run the file , when you do it , it asks for the thing you wanna purchase, as a pentester you should have this habit of  giving  unusual input for to see as how the prgrm behaves , so when we give the -ve value , there&#39;s no filter for that , it increases our coins , thus when buying give the -ve quantity and buy the flag, we will get the ascii values for the flag characters , use python chr() functionto change them:</p><p>picoCTF{b4d_brogrammer_b8d7271f}</p></div>
