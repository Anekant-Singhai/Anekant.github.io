<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>MRROBOT_1</h1><br/><p>first of all lets see what is machine actually is we do the nmap on this target we get to know that it&#39;s a webserver then , if it&#39;s a webserver it must have a robots.txt , we find this file we get 2 things first is the dictionary and the key , it says it&#39;s one of the 3 keys and so there are 3 keys somewhere</p><p></p><p>first key - 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9 from robots.txt</p><p></p><p>I found a login page on the website , it was from the wordpress when I entered the username and the password I got to know that it was telling that the username was incorrect which meant that we could ignore the password this time, used the hydra command-</p><p></p><p>hydra -L fsocity_filtered.dic -p something 10.38.1.110 http-post-form &#39;/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&amp;pwd=^PASS^&amp;wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username&#39;</p><p></p><p>where I got a username called elliot then when I entered th eusername , this time it showed that the password was incorrect, I used the dictionary that was sorted for the unique names in there as they repeated via a command:</p><p>sort fsocity.dic | uniq &gt; fsocity_filtered.dic</p><p></p><p>this time I got the password too (ER28-0652) , logged onto the website then I found the two users there one was elliot and other was krista</p><p>her username was mich05654 the password I found from the filtered dict(Dylan_2791)</p><p></p><p>clicked to generate the passwd : o%cI!KVV#K1$gZkFl#S%rPHV</p><p></p><p>I found the media site and then ....</p><p>I used the metasploit to gain access to their shells but that wasn&#39;t enough , I wasn&#39;t getting the full control so I used the python script =</p><p>	 python -c &#39;import pty;pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;)&#39;</p><p>what we do is we upgrade from basic reverse shell to fully interactive tty where pty is a powerful lib for manipulating the OS and we can also spawn a new process via spawn method, so here we used to spawn a anew terminal	</p><p>after that browsing to the home dir , doing ls I found a usr called the &quot;robot&quot; which means that we have our next clues there </p><p>so when we go into and check for contents we find that we have 2 files where doing the cat on 1st we get permission denied after that we get the 2nd one accessible and when we &#39;cat&#39; it we can see the password kinda thing and if u notice the file name password-md5 whch means its md5 encrypted so we need to decrypt it </p><p>we get the username robot and the password = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz as the creds</p><p></p><p>so we change the user to robot via &#39;su robot&#39; </p><p>and with the passwd</p><p></p><p>then we can cat the forbidden file with the value 822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959 in it which is our 2nd key</p><p></p><p>but then we further go deep into the systems to just to see the user files with the command:</p><p>find / -perm --400 -type f 2&gt;/dev/null</p><p>and voila...what have we here </p><p>we see that this machine has nmap installed and we can gain root access lvl shell via using nmap in interactive mode</p><p>nmap --interactive</p><p>we can run shell commands by just adding ! in the front....try !whoami</p><p>then we go look into the root dir via !ls /root</p><p>and we get the last key - 04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4</p></div>
