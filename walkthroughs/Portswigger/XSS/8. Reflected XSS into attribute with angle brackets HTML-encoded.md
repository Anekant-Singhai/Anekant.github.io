***
This lab contains a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) vulnerability in the search blog functionality where angle brackets are HTML-encoded. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects an attribute and calls the `alert` function.

The search bar provided reflects the search we do

This is how it is rendered:

inside the value attribute
When we inject the payload we see this:

The tags aren't colored meaning they aren't being rendered , not being treated as tags
Ofcourse , the lab description said they are being encoded :

We cannot use tags now , so do you know about the event handlers like onclick , onload , onmouseover and all where we define the html to perform some action if the particular event happens .
And we know that our input is going into the value attribute , so we can somehow if escape the value attribute and add our own attribute the event handler and say it to pop alert when the event occurs:
So our payload goes:
```
hello"onmouseover="alert(1)
```

But that  solvers the lab , we need to give some POC as hint says...hmm what POC? , like this :
we need to tell the vendor that this xss is from your site not some 3rd party so we do `window.location`  or `document.domain`, we get the site name it confirms xss is on that site
