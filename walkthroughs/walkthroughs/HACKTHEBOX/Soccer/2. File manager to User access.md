After getting the file manager we see that there's a folder called tiny and all the files and folders have root as owner and group

we somehow need to find a file that we can edit to and call to get a reverse shell

while going into the tiny -> we find uploads folder  this must the one we can upload to , I got the pentestmonkey php shell and uploaded it
[[https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell]]

now we just need to call it 
when we click on open after editing it we get the shell
making the shell stable 
shell stable is when you you do ctrl+c you don't get kicked out of shell:
***
step 1:
```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

step 2:
do `ctrl+z` your main system terminal should have opened and then write this:
```
stty raw -echo; fg
```

then press `enter` two times , your terminal for the machine should be back , also type this to get some env variables like clear in that machine:
```
export TERM=xterm
```
***

My first step after getting the shell is to look for anything that can help me escalate the priveleges , starting from the user directory 
when we go to the user directory called 'player' we get a user.txt but we cannot open it due to the fact it is owned by root and group player , so we need to do something

when we look for the process in the network running we see this:

processes :

There are process being hidden from another user:

so we need to find something of use
