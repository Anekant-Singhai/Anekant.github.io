Now when we wanna add the html we typed , but highly rich and so much html can't be typed inside so that's where the templates come in picture

we can put these html inside that template folder and we can add another directory there called "blog"
so it goes:
blog -> templates -> blog
inside that blog we create for now 2 files : home.html and about.html

NOW we have that apps.py file , now this is the file that contains our application library which we need to mention to the main project in which more that one could be run , so where to keep track or where to mention?:
in the `settings.py` file and what to mention:

look at this 'BlogConfig' this inherits from AppConfig class above , copy this blogconfig and add here in the `INSTALLED_APPS` section inside that list

Now how to define that template in the doc so that we can load it in the site:
