Description:
Check out our museum of artifacts! Apparently, soon they will allow public submissions, just like in Animal Crossing!  
  
Retrieve the flag out of `/flag.txt` in the root of the file system.

The interface will look like this:

and when we click on anyone:
![[Pasted image 20230617151713.png]]

with the url: `http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31682/browse?artifact=cat.jpeg`

look at here something? a parameter: `/browse?artifact=cat.jpeg`
and an endpoint `/browse`
