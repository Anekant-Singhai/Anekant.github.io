when we search:
![[Pasted image 20230719003230.png]]
Says the javascript:
![[Pasted image 20230719003302.png]]
you can look up this blog of mine for XSS of this kind I wrote to approach for:
`https://medium.com/@anekantsinghai/best-approach-to-dom-xss-c238ba2e278b`

we identify the sink: 
`document.getElementById('searchMessage').innerHTML = query;`
innerHTML is used for adding the html inside a tag like:
document.body.innerHTML = `<h1>hello</h1>` gives:
![[Pasted image 20230719003809.png]]
so this code is adding our query to the element who'se id is 'searchMessage'
let's have a look on how it's rendered in order to bypass:
![[Pasted image 20230719004025.png]]
so when we try to add a basic exploit: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
it renders:
![[Pasted image 20230719004207.png]]
and:
![[Pasted image 20230719004238.png]]
inside the span tag inside this h1 tag , we saw the code above the span tag had this id.
also location.search says: ![[Pasted image 20230719004618.png]]
## Poisoning the sink
Since we cannot execute script , but we can add tags here , so why don't we add an img tag containing the payload in the onerror event handler:
`<img src=x onerror='alert(1)'/>`
