### challenge itself:
***This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

## Approach 

So we go to the brute-force approach and look for error:

it says invalid username or password , so we don't get a clue whether username is wrong or the password

also we check for rate-limit -> here there's none
so we need to give the payloads permutations , we can do this via burp-pro's feature called clusterbomb:

we paste the 2 lists we got from the lab and start the attack:

and then we get the 302 code and length very small:
