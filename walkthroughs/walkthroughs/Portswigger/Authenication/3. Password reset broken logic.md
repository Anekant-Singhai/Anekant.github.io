So we got a new lab , and we look around we see a new functionality called "forgot password"

we when go to the page , it prompts us to give us our email or username , when we give 'wiener' , which was provided to us , we get an email and check the email client gives us:

so this is the link we have to use to reset password....
we get this prompt to fill in the new password:

look at the request it is sending:

what if we change the name from wiener to carlos

we did it


### Things to look for:
* we need to look for if the password reset link:
	* Is the link still valid after being used -> here it is
	* we need to check whether we can do user-enum in forget password endpoint like it saying no user of such name or sent to email when found the legit user 
	* Is the link changing everytime we are sending or the same one? -> here it isn't:

		also we need to check whether we can , without any limit send multiple password reset messages to the email client
		here there's no rate-limit
